Types and Optics
================

Freya uses optics to provide access to various aspects of the request and response state, as well as other data which may be generated as part of processing, such as route data (see :doc:`/core/optics` if you're not familiar with this). The optics provided map the underlying data to and from typed representations, which use the :doc:`/types-and-optics/arachne` project.
