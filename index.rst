Freya Documentation
===================

`Freya <http://freya.io>`_ is a functional-style web programming stack for F#.
Freya builds on top of the `Open Web Interface for .NET <http://owin.org/>`_
(OWIN) and provides several layers of abstraction, each useful in its own right
for building web applications. The documentation describes each of these layers
and their intended use, design, and dependencies.

We happily accept pull requests for changes, additions, and improvements to
both the libraries, documentation, and examples. If there's content you'd like
to see and which doesn't appear to be referenced (even as a placeholder) please
raise an issue `here <https://github.com/freya-fs/freya.documentation/issues>`_,
and we'll do our best to address it.
