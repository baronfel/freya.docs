Router
======

The :doc:`/core/index` library, along with the :doc:`/types-and-optics/index` libraries, let you create a powerful and expressive handler for an HTTP request and serve it via an OWIN server, but the chances are you have more than one thing you'd like to serve. It's a rare project that doesn't need some concept of *routing*.

Freya comes with a powerful router in the ``Freya.Router`` library, which integrates well with the approaches we've seen working in the Core library.
